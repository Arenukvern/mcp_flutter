# Overview

The whole server is now divided into two parts:

## AI Agent Tools

### Error Analysis

- `get_app_errors` [Resource|Tool] - Retrieves precise and condensed error information from your Flutter app
  **Usage**:

  - Uses only short description of the error. Should filter duplicate errors, to avoid flooding Agent context window with the same errors.
  - Uses Error Monitor to capture Dart VM errors. Meaning: first, start mcp server, forwarding server, start app, open devtools and extension, and then reload app, to capture errors. All errors will be captured in the DevTools Extension (mcp_toolkit).

  **Tested on**:
  ‚úÖ macOS, ‚úÖ iOS
  **Not tested on**:
  üöß Android, ü§î Windows, ü§î Linux, ‚ùå Web
  [See issue](https://github.com/Arenukvern/mcp_flutter/issues/23)

### Development Tools

- `screenshot` [Resource|Tool] - Captures a screenshot of the running application.
  **Configuration**:

  - Enable with `--images` flag or `IMAGES_SUPPORTED=true` environment variable
  - May use compression to optimize image size

- `hot_reload` [Tool] - Performs hot reload of the Flutter application
  **Tested on**:
  ‚úÖ macOS, ‚úÖ iOS, ‚úÖ Android
  **Not tested on**:
  ü§î Windows, ü§î Linux, ‚ùå Web
  [See issue](https://github.com/Arenukvern/mcp_flutter/issues/23)

### Work in progress

- `get_app_info` [Resource|Tool] - size of screen, pixel ratio. May unlock ability for an Agent to use widget selection.
- [Resource|Tool] **Selection tool**:
  Current idea:

  1. Enable widget selection in Flutter Inspector.
  2. Select widget by logical pixel position.
  3. Get detailed information about your Flutter app's structure based on logical pixel position.

### In research:

- **Inspect Current Route**: See current navigation state
- **Extensions: Flutter Provider/Riverpod states**: Get state of Provider/Riverpod instances.
- **Extensions: Jaspr**: ?
- **Extensions: Jaspr Provider**: ?
- **Extensions: Flame**: ?

## Direct RPC Dart VM Calls

Debug methods, utility methods, which are useful for experimenting with MCP development. Most of these methods are quite heavy and can overload context window of MCP agent.

### Utility Methods

These are helper methods that provide additional functionality beyond direct Flutter RPC calls:

#### VM finding (useful for debugging)

- `get_active_ports`: Lists all Flutter/Dart processes listening on ports
- `get_supported_protocols`: Retrieves supported protocols from a Flutter app
- `get_vm`: Gets detailed VM information from a running Flutter app
- `get_extension_rpcs`: Lists all available extension RPCs in the Flutter app

#### DartIO Methods (ext.dart.io.\*)

- `dart_io_get_version`: Gets Flutter version information

#### Dumps (To enable, use `--dumps` flag or ENV variable DUMPS_SUPPORTED=true)

- `debug_dump_render_tree`: Dumps the render tree structure
- `debug_dump_layer_tree`: Dumps the layer tree for rendering analysis
- `debug_dump_semantics_tree`: Dumps the semantics tree for accessibility analysis
- `debug_dump_focus_tree`: Dumps the focus tree for input handling analysis
