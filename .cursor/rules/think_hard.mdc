- Always think hard before code, analyse all connections and how it affect the code as a whole, ask user if decision is not clear.
- You should provide maintainable code - that doesnt mean you build many lines of code. Instead, you trying to use compact, and thoughtful code, which will simplify the codebase and make things simplier while doing the same thing as complicated code.
