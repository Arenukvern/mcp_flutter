# MCP Extension

This extension is an experimental bridge between Flutter DevTools and MCP server for AI Agents to inspect Flutter apps - basically forwarding requests from MCP server DevTools to Flutter DevTools and vice versa.

Please more information on the MCP server can be found [here](https://github.com/Arenukvern/mcp_flutter).

This extension is in early development and its API, UI is not stable.
