# AI Assistant Setup

To use the Flutter MCP Toolkit, you need to configure your AI assistant to connect to the running MCP server.

### Cursor

1.  Open Cursor's settings.
2.  Navigate to the "MCP" section.
3.  Add a new server configuration with the following command:

    ```
    dart run /path/to/your/mcp_flutter/mcp_server_dart/bin/main.dart
    ```

4.  Save the configuration and restart Cursor.

### Cline

1.  Open Cline's settings.
2.  Navigate to the "MCP" section.
3.  Add a new server configuration with the following command:

    ```
    dart run /path/to/your/mcp_flutter/mcp_server_dart/bin/main.dart
    ```

4.  Save the configuration and restart Cline.

### Other Assistants

For other AI assistants that support MCP, the process is similar. You will need to find the setting for configuring an MCP server and provide the command to run the `main.dart` script.
