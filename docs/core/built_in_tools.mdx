# Built-in Tools

The Flutter MCP Toolkit comes with a set of pre-built tools and resources for common development tasks.

Note:

- Requires a connected Flutter app in debug mode with VM service enabled (see the run flags above).
- If VM service is not connected, the tool returns an error message instead of failing the whole request.

### Core Tools

- **`hot_reload_flutter`**: Performs a hot reload of the Flutter app.
- **`hot_restart_flutter`**: Performs a hot restart of the Flutter app.
- **`get_vm`**: Returns information about the Dart VM.
- **`get_extension_rpcs`**: Lists the available extension RPCs in the Flutter app.

### Hot Restart Tool Usage

The server now provides a dedicated hot restart tool for situations where hot reload isn't sufficient (for example after adding service extensions or when the app state is corrupted):

```json
{
  "name": "hot_restart_flutter",
  "arguments": {}
}
```

Expected result:

```json
{
  "message": "{\"report\":{\"type\":\"Success\",\"success\":true}}"
}
```

### Debug Dump Tools

These tools are disabled by default and can be enabled with the `--dumps` flag.

- **`debug_dump_layer_tree`**: Dumps the layer tree.
- **`debug_dump_semantics_tree`**: Dumps the semantics tree.
- **`debug_dump_render_tree`**: Dumps the render tree.
- **`debug_dump_focus_tree`**: Dumps the focus tree.

### Resources

- **`visual://localhost/app/errors/latest`**: Gets the latest errors from the app.
- **`visual://localhost/view/details`**: Gets details about the current view.
- **`visual://localhost/view/screenshots`**: Takes a screenshot of the app.
