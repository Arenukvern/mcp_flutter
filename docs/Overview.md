# Overview

Welcome to the Flutter MCP Toolkit! This project provides a powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects your Flutter applications with AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude, and Cline.

### What It Does

At its core, this project acts as a bridge, allowing an AI to inspect and interact with your running Flutter app. This enables a new level of AI-powered development where the assistant can:

- **Read Runtime Data:** Access information about the widget tree, screen size, and more.
- **Identify Errors:** Automatically detect and report runtime errors from the Dart VM.
- **Take Screenshots:** Capture the current state of your app's UI for visual inspection.
- **Execute Custom Actions:** Run custom tools that you define within your Flutter app.

### Key Feature: Dynamic Tool Registration

The standout feature is **dynamic tool registration**. You can create custom tools directly within your Flutter application and make them available to the AI assistant at runtime. This allows you to tailor the AI's capabilities to your specific application and debugging needs.

### Who Is This For?

This project is for any Flutter developer who wants to leverage the power of AI to accelerate their workflow. Whether you're debugging a complex UI issue, automating repetitive tasks, or simply want a more intelligent development partner, the Flutter MCP Toolkit can help.
