# ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**

   - Ensure your Flutter app is running in debug mode
   - Verify the port matches in both Flutter app and MCP server
   - Check if the port is not being used by another process

2. **AI Tool Not Detecting Inspector**

   - Restart the AI tool after configuration changes
   - Verify the configuration JSON syntax
   - Check the tool's logs for connection errors

3. **Dynamic Tools Not Appearing**
   - Ensure `mcp_toolkit` package is properly initialized in your Flutter app
   - Check that tools are registered using `MCPToolkitBinding.instance.addEntries()`
   - Use `listClientToolsAndResources` to verify registration
   - Hot reload your Flutter app after adding new tools
