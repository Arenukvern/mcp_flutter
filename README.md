# Flutter Inspector MCP Server for AI-Powered Development

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Arenukvern/mcp_flutter)

üîç A powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects your Flutter apps with AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude, and Cline.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- A Flutter app running in debug mode
- One of: Cursor, Claude, or Cline AI assistant

### Installation from GitHub

For developers who want to contribute to the project or run the latest version directly from source, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arenukvern/mcp_flutter
   cd flutter-inspector
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command installs all necessary dependencies listed in `package.json`.

3. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command compiles the TypeScript code and creates the `build` directory with the compiled JavaScript files, including `build/index.js`.

4. **Run the Flutter Inspector server:**
   ```bash
   node build/index.js --stdio
   ```
   This command starts the server in stdio mode. You can also use:
   ```bash
   npx -y . --stdio # if you prefer to use npx, ensure package.json "main" points to build/index.js
   ```

After these steps, you can configure your AI coding assistant to use the Flutter Inspector server. Refer to the "üõ†Ô∏è Add Flutter Inspector to your AI tool" section for configuration details.

### 1-Minute Setup

1. **Start your Flutter app in debug mode**

! Current workaround for security reasons is to run with `--disable-service-auth-codes`. If you know how to fix this, please let me know!

```bash
flutter run --debug --observatory-port=8181 --enable-vm-service --disable-service-auth-codes
```

2. **Run Flutter Inspector (Global Install)**

   ```bash
   npx flutter-inspector --port=3334
   ```

3. **üõ†Ô∏è Add Flutter Inspector to your AI tool**

   **Note for Local Development (GitHub Install):**

   If you installed the Flutter Inspector from GitHub and built it locally, you need to adjust the paths in the AI tool configurations to point to your local `build/index.js` file. Refer to the "Installation from GitHub" section for instructions on cloning and building the project.

   #### Cursor Setup

   1. Open Cursor's settings
   2. Go to the Features tab
   3. Under "Model Context Protocol", add the server:
      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "flutter-inspector": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["/path/to/your/cloned/flutter-inspector/build/index.js"],
            "env": {},
            "disabled": false,
            "autoApprove": []
          }
        }
      }
      ```
   4. Restart Cursor
   5. Open Composer in agent mode
   6. You're ready! Try commands like "analyze my Flutter app's widget tree"

   #### Claude Setup

   1. Add to your Claude configuration file:
      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "flutter-inspector": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["/path/to/your/cloned/flutter-inspector/build/index.js"],
            "env": {
              "PORT": "3334",
              "LOG_LEVEL": "info"
            },
            "disabled": false
          }
        }
      }
      ```
   2. Restart Claude
   3. The Flutter inspector tools will be automatically available

   #### Cline Setup

   1. Add to your `.cline/config.json`:
      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "flutter-inspector": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["/path/to/your/cloned/flutter-inspector/build/index.js"],
            "env": {
              "PORT": "3334",
              "LOG_LEVEL": "info"
            },
            "disabled": false
          }
        }
      }
      ```
   2. Restart Cline
   3. The Flutter inspector will be automatically available in your conversations

## üéØ What You Can Do

- **Analyze Widget Trees**: Get detailed information about your Flutter app's structure
- **Inspect Navigation**: See current routes and navigation state
- **Debug Layout Issues**: Understand widget relationships and properties
- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Get smarter code suggestions based on your app's context

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

```bash
PORT=3334              # Server port (default: 3334)
LOG_LEVEL=info        # Logging level (error, warn, info, debug)
```

### Command Line Arguments

```bash
--port, -p     # Server port
--stdio        # Run in stdio mode (default: true)
--log-level    # Set logging level
--help         # Show help
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**

   - Ensure your Flutter app is running in debug mode
   - Verify the port matches in both Flutter app and inspector
   - Check if the port is not being used by another process

2. **AI Tool Not Detecting Inspector**
   - Restart the AI tool after configuration changes
   - Verify the configuration JSON syntax
   - Check the tool's logs for connection errors
