# Project Brief

**Project Name:** Flutter Inspector MCP Server

**Goal:** Connect Flutter apps with AI coding assistants (Cursor, Claude, Cline) via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**Key Features:** Enable AI to interact with Flutter apps for analysis, debugging, and code suggestions. Specifically: widget tree analysis, navigation inspection, layout debugging.

**Communication Paths:** Direct VM Service communication (for basic VM operations) and Flutter-specific communication (via a forwarding server, for widget inspection, etc.).
