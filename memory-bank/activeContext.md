# Active Development Context

## Current Focus

- Implementation of robust object group management in the Flutter Inspector MCP Server
- Error detection and analysis in Flutter widget trees
- Memory management optimization for inspector operations

## Recent Decisions

### Object Group Management Pattern

1. **Lifecycle Management**

   - Using `ObjectGroupManager` for centralized group lifecycle control
   - Implementing next/promote pattern for safe group transitions
   - Proper cleanup through dispose mechanisms

2. **Error Detection System**
   - Semantic analysis of widget tree nodes
   - Pattern-based error detection in node descriptions
   - Categorization of common Flutter UI errors

### Implementation Details

#### Object Group Lifecycle

```dart
// Creation and initialization
_objectGroupManager = ObjectGroupManager(
  debugName: 'visual-errors',
  vmService: service,
  isolate: mainIsolate,
);

// Usage pattern
final group = _objectGroupManager.next;
try {
  // Use group
  await operation();
  await _objectGroupManager.promoteNext();
} catch (e) {
  await _objectGroupManager.cancelNext();
  rethrow;
}
```

#### Error Detection Categories

- Layout Overflow
- Usage Error
- Invalid State
- Operation Failed
- General Error

## Next Steps

1. Implement additional error detection patterns
2. Add performance monitoring for object group operations
3. Enhance error reporting with more detailed diagnostics
4. Consider implementing batch operations for multiple widget tree analyses

## Open Questions

- Should we implement caching for frequently accessed widget tree nodes?
- How can we optimize memory usage during large tree traversals?
- What additional error patterns should we consider?

## Dependencies

- VM Service Protocol for Flutter inspector communication
- Object Group Manager for memory management
- Remote Diagnostics Node for widget tree analysis

## Current Challenges

1. Optimizing memory usage during tree traversal
2. Balancing granularity of error detection
3. Ensuring proper cleanup of resources

## Recent Improvements

1. Implemented proper object group lifecycle management
2. Enhanced error detection patterns
3. Added robust error handling
4. Improved resource cleanup mechanisms
