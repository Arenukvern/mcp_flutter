# Active Context

**Current Focus:** Planning Object Group Management for DevTools Extension VM Service interactions.

**Recent Decisions/Learnings:**

- Adopted the `ObjectGroup` / `ObjectGroupManager` pattern from Flutter DevTools to manage VM object references and prevent memory leaks in the inspected application.
- Identified `devtools_mcp_extension/lib/services/devtools_service.dart` as the primary integration point for this pattern.
- Created a detailed implementation plan: `devtools_mcp_extension/object_group_implementation_plan.md`.

**Next Steps:** Continue implementation based on the plan file, starting with refactoring other VM call methods in `DevtoolsService`.

### Active Context: Implementing `getErrors` Function

**Current Work Focus:**

- Implementing the `getErrors` function in `custom_devtools_service.dart`.
- This function aims to retrieve visual errors (like layout overflows, render issues) from a Flutter application by inspecting the remote diagnostics tree via the VM service.
- We are currently in the planning and research phase, focusing on understanding how DevTools identifies and reports errors and how to effectively use the VM service and `ObjectGroup` pattern.

**Recent Changes & Steps:**

- Developed a refined plan for implementing `getErrors`, focusing on using remote diagnostics nodes and `ObjectGroupManager`.
- Researched the `devtools_app` codebase, specifically the inspector and diagnostics modules, to understand error detection mechanisms and VM service interactions.
- Analyzed `RemoteDiagnosticsNode` properties (`level`, `exception`, `description`, `style`) as potential indicators of visual errors.
- Identified `getRootWidgetTree` VM service extension as the method to fetch the remote root `DiagnosticsNode`.
- Clarified the definition of "visual errors" and refined follow-up questions to guide further research.

**Next Steps:**

- Continue research in `devtools_app` to pinpoint the exact code for error detection logic and obtain example JSON structures of error nodes.
- Refine the error detection strategy based on research findings.
- Start implementing the `getErrors` function in `custom_devtools_service.dart`, focusing on remote tree retrieval, error identification, and `ObjectGroup` integration.
- Write unit and integration tests to verify the functionality of `getErrors`.

**Active Decisions & Considerations:**

- **Remote Diagnostics:** We are committed to using remote diagnostics nodes via the VM service for accurate error retrieval, avoiding local bindings.
- **Object Group Management:** We will implement `ObjectGroupManager` to manage VM service calls and prevent memory leaks, following the pattern used in DevTools.
- **Error Detection Logic:** We are researching the best approach to identify errors within `RemoteDiagnosticsNode` properties, considering `level`, `exception`, `description`, and `style`.
- **Error Categorization:** We will initially use strings for `errorType` and refine error categories as we progress.

**Important Patterns & Preferences:**

- **Semantic Intent Paradigm (SIP):** While not explicitly defined for this specific function yet, we are adhering to the principles of SIP by focusing on clear intent and well-defined functionality.
- **Command-Resource Pattern:** `getErrors` function will likely be part of a command (e.g., `GetVisualErrorsCommand`) that interacts with a resource (e.g., `VisualErrorResource`), although this is not yet fully defined.
- **Writing Code Protocol:** We are following the writing code protocol by placing implementation near intent (though intent is still implicit), exporting files, and focusing on concise and maintainable code.

**Learnings & Project Insights:**

- Deeper understanding of Flutter DevTools codebase, particularly the inspector module and `RemoteDiagnosticsNode` structure.
- Appreciation for the `ObjectGroup` pattern in managing VM service interactions and preventing memory leaks.
- Recognition of the importance of precise error definition and robust error detection logic.
- Need for further research to pinpoint concrete error detection code and example error node JSONs in DevTools.
