# Active Context

**Current Focus:** Planning Object Group Management for DevTools Extension VM Service interactions.

**Recent Decisions/Learnings:**

- Adopted the `ObjectGroup` / `ObjectGroupManager` pattern from Flutter DevTools to manage VM object references and prevent memory leaks in the inspected application.
- Identified `devtools_mcp_extension/lib/services/devtools_service.dart` as the primary integration point for this pattern.
- Created a detailed implementation plan: `devtools_mcp_extension/object_group_implementation_plan.md`.

**Next Steps:** Continue implementation based on the plan file, starting with refactoring other VM call methods in `DevtoolsService`.
