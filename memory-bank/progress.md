# Progress

**Status:** Object Group Management - Planning Complete.

**What Works:**

- Basic project structure exists.
- Detailed implementation plan for Object Group Management is created: `devtools_mcp_extension/object_group_implementation_plan.md`.
- Added `uuid` dependency to `devtools_mcp_extension/pubspec.yaml` and ran `flutter pub get`.
- Created `ObjectGroup` and `ObjectGroupManager` classes in `devtools_mcp_extension/lib/services/object_group_manager.dart`.
- Integrated `ObjectGroupManager` into `DevtoolsService`.
- Refactored `getRootWidget` method in `DevtoolsService` to use `ObjectGroupManager`.
- Verified generic `callServiceExtension` method in `DevtoolsService`.

**What's Left:**

- Implement Object Group Management in `devtools_mcp_extension` (following the plan).
- Implement the core functionality of the MCP server, DevTools extension, and forwarding server.
- Implement specific RPC methods.

**Known Issues:** The README mentions that not all Flutter Inspector related methods are implemented yet.
