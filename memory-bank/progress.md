# Progress

**Status:** Object Group Management - Planning Complete.

**What Works:**

- Basic project structure exists.
- Detailed implementation plan for Object Group Management is created: `devtools_mcp_extension/object_group_implementation_plan.md`.
- Added `uuid` dependency to `devtools_mcp_extension/pubspec.yaml` and ran `flutter pub get`.
- Created `ObjectGroup` and `ObjectGroupManager` classes in `devtools_mcp_extension/lib/services/object_group_manager.dart`.
- Integrated `ObjectGroupManager` into `DevtoolsService`.
- Refactored `getRootWidget` method in `DevtoolsService` to use `ObjectGroupManager`.
- Verified generic `callServiceExtension` method in `DevtoolsService`.

**What's Left:**

- Implement Object Group Management in `devtools_mcp_extension` (following the plan).
- Implement the core functionality of the MCP server, DevTools extension, and forwarding server.
- Implement specific RPC methods.

**Known Issues:** The README mentions that not all Flutter Inspector related methods are implemented yet.

### Progress: Implementing `getErrors` Function

**What Works:**

- Initial plan for `getErrors` function is defined.
- Research into DevTools codebase and VM service interaction is underway.
- Understanding of `ObjectGroup` pattern and its importance is established.
- Refined plan incorporating remote diagnostics and object groups is in place.

**What's Left to Build:**

- Implement the `getErrors` function in `custom_devtools_service.dart`.
  - Remote diagnostics tree retrieval using `getRootWidgetTree`.
  - Tree traversal and error detection logic based on `RemoteDiagnosticsNode` properties.
  - Integration of `ObjectGroupManager`.
  - Data formatting for error reporting.
- Write unit and integration tests for `getErrors`.
- Further research to refine error detection logic and categorization.

**Current Status:**

- Planning and research phase is nearing completion.
- Implementation phase is about to begin.
- Key technical decisions regarding remote diagnostics and object groups are made.

**Known Issues & Open Questions:**

- **Error Detection Logic Details:** Need to pinpoint the exact error detection logic in DevTools codebase. (Follow-up question 1 in the refined plan).
- **Example Error Node JSONs:** Need example JSON structures of error nodes for robust error detection pattern creation. (Follow-up question 2 in the refined plan).
- **Error Categorization:** Error types are currently strings; consider refining to enums later.
- **Performance:** Performance implications of tree traversal and remote diagnostics calls need to be considered during implementation and testing.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**

- **Initial Approach (Incorrect):** Initially considered using local `WidgetsBinding.instance.rootElement` for inspection, which was identified as incorrect.
- **Current Approach (Corrected):** Shifted to using remote diagnostics nodes via VM service for accurate representation of the debuggable application's tree.
- **Memory Management:** Recognized the importance of `ObjectGroup` pattern from DevTools for memory management and incorporated it into the plan.
