# Product Context

**Problem:** Developers need better tools for understanding and debugging Flutter applications, especially complex UIs.

**Solution:** This project provides an MCP server that allows AI assistants to access and interact with Flutter apps, providing insights and assistance.

**How it Works:** The server acts as a bridge between the Flutter app (running in debug mode) and the AI assistant, translating requests and responses between MCP and the VM Service Protocol.

**User Experience Goals:** Seamless integration with AI assistants, real-time insights into the Flutter app, improved debugging workflow.
