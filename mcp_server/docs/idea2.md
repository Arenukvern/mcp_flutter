Okay, let's distill the core principle for enabling an AI agent to work effectively with a dynamically changing set of tools, abstracting away the TypeScript-specific implementation details. This principle would be applicable whether the MCP server is written in TypeScript, Dart, Python, or any other language.

**The Meta-Tool Discovery Principle for Dynamic Toolsets**

**Core Problem:** An AI agent connected to a server (e.g., an MCP server) may not be aware of tools that are registered or unregistered _dynamically_ by a backend application (e.g., a running Flutter app) after the agent's initial tool discovery phase.

**Principle:**

1.  **Expose a "Tool Catalog Service":**

    - The server MUST provide a well-defined, callable service (a "meta-tool") that the AI agent can invoke at any time.
    - Let's call this service `getToolCatalog` (or a similar descriptive name).

2.  **Catalog Service Responsibilities:**

    - **Return Comprehensive Tool Information:** When called, this `getToolCatalog` service MUST return a structured list of _all currently available tools_. This includes both statically defined tools and any tools dynamically registered by backend applications.
    - **Describe Each Tool:** For each tool in the catalog, the service MUST provide:
      - **Unique Name:** A stable identifier for the tool.
      - **Purpose Description:** A clear, natural language explanation of what the tool does, its intended use cases, and when the AI agent should consider using it. This is crucial for the AI's reasoning.
      - **Parameter Schema:** A machine-readable definition of the input parameters the tool expects (e.g., names, types, whether they are required or optional, and descriptions for each parameter). This allows the AI to correctly formulate requests to execute the tool. The schema MUST be compatible with MCP's tool schema format, which includes:
        ```yaml
        name: string # Required: Unique identifier for the tool
        description: string # Required: Clear explanation of tool's purpose
        parameters: # Required: Input parameters definition
          type: object
          properties: # Tool-specific parameters
            param1:
              type: string # Parameter type
              description: string # Parameter description
          required: [param1] # Required parameters list
        ```
      - **(Optional but Recommended) Source/Origin:** Information about whether the tool is static to the server or dynamically provided by a specific backend application.

3.  **(Optional but Recommended) On-Demand Refresh Capability:**

    - The `getToolCatalog` service SHOULD offer an optional parameter (e.g., `force_refresh: boolean`) that, if true, instructs the server to actively query its backend applications to update their list of dynamically registered tools _before_ compiling and returning the catalog. This ensures the AI can request the absolute freshest toolset.

4.  **Standard Tool Execution Mechanism:**
    - The server MUST have a separate, standard mechanism for _executing_ any tool (e.g., an MCP `tools/call` endpoint that takes a `tool_name` and `arguments`).
    - The AI agent, after discovering a tool and its parameters via `getToolCatalog`, will use this standard execution mechanism to invoke the tool. The catalog service itself does _not_ execute the tools; it only describes them.

**AI Agent's Interaction Workflow:**

1.  **Initial State:** The agent might have an initial, possibly incomplete or outdated, list of tools.
2.  **Need for Action/Information:** The user makes a request, or the AI's internal logic determines a need that might involve a tool it doesn't currently recognize or wants to ensure is up-to-date.
3.  **Invoke Catalog Service:** The AI agent calls the server's `getToolCatalog` service (potentially with `force_refresh` if it suspects recent changes).
4.  **Process Catalog:** The AI receives the structured list of tools and their descriptions/schemas. It parses this information to understand what tools are available and how to use them.
5.  **Formulate Tool Execution Request:** Based on its reasoning and the information from the catalog, the AI selects an appropriate tool and constructs a request for the server's standard tool execution mechanism, providing the correct tool name and arguments according to the retrieved schema.
6.  **Execute Tool:** The AI sends this execution request to the server.
7.  **Receive Result:** The server executes the target tool (which might involve routing the request to the dynamic backend application) and returns the result to the AI.

**Benefits of this Principle:**

- **Decoupling:** Discovery (`getToolCatalog`) is separate from execution (`tools/call`).
- **Always Up-to-Date:** The AI can always request the latest toolset.
- **Rich Semantics:** Descriptions and schemas empower the AI to understand and correctly use tools.
- **Language Agnostic:** The principle applies regardless of the server's or backend application's programming language, as long as they can communicate over the defined service interface (e.g., RPC, HTTP).
- **Standardization:** The AI interacts with all tools (static or dynamic) via a consistent discovery and execution pattern.
- **MCP Compatibility:** All dynamic tools MUST adhere to MCP's tool schema format, ensuring seamless integration with existing MCP infrastructure and tooling.

This principle ensures that the AI agent remains a powerful and adaptable partner, capable of leveraging the full, evolving capabilities of the applications it interacts with via the server.
