# Dart Dynamic Registration Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the migration plan from the TypeScript MCP server's dynamic tool registration system to a Dart implementation with significant improvements. The goal is to create a fully MCP-compliant dynamic registration system that's more efficient and maintainable than the original TypeScript version.

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Full MCP Protocol Compliance

**TypeScript Issues:**

- Custom JSON serialization that may not align with MCP protocol
- Manual tool/resource management outside standard MCP flow

**Dart Solution:**

- Uses native MCP `Tool` and `Resource` objects directly
- Leverages existing `ToolsSupport` and `ResourcesSupport` mixins
- Automatic MCP protocol compliance through wrapper pattern

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture

**Features:**

- Real-time event streaming for registration/unregistration
- Comprehensive event types: `ToolRegisteredEvent`, `ResourceRegisteredEvent`, `AppUnregisteredEvent`
- Built-in monitoring and debugging capabilities

### 3. Efficient Registry Management

**Key Improvements:**

- Hash-map based lookups for O(1) tool/resource access
- Automatic cleanup when Flutter apps disconnect
- Port change detection and re-registration
- Activity tracking for connection monitoring

## Core Components

### 1. DynamicRegistry (`lib/src/services/dynamic_registry.dart`)

The core registry that manages dynamically registered tools and resources:

```dart
// Register MCP-compliant tools
void registerTool(Tool tool, String sourceApp, int dartVmPort, {Map<String, dynamic> metadata = const {}});

// Register MCP-compliant resources
void registerResource(Resource resource, String sourceApp, int dartVmPort, {Map<String, dynamic> metadata = const {}});

// Forward tool calls to appropriate Flutter app
Future<CallToolResult?> forwardToolCall(String toolName, Map<String, Object?>? arguments);

// Forward resource reads to appropriate Flutter app
Future<List<Content>?> forwardResourceRead(String resourceUri);
```

**Key Features:**

- Full MCP protocol compliance
- Event streaming for real-time updates
- Automatic cleanup and connection management
- Statistics and monitoring

### 2. DynamicRegistryTools (`lib/src/services/dynamic_registry_tools.dart`)

Management tools exposed via MCP protocol:

- `listClientToolsAndResources` - List all dynamically registered tools/resources
- `runClientTool` - Execute a dynamic tool
- `runClientResource` - Read from a dynamic resource
- `getRegistryStats` - Get registry statistics

**Benefits:**

- Fully configurable (can be enabled/disabled)
- Standard MCP tool interface
- JSON output for easy consumption
- Filtering and metadata support

### 3. DynamicRegistryIntegration (`lib/src/mixins/dynamic_registry_integration.dart`)

Mixin that integrates dynamic registry with existing MCP server:

```dart
base mixin DynamicRegistryIntegration on BaseMCPToolkitServer {
  // Initialize with configuration
  void initializeDynamicRegistry({bool enabled = true});

  // Register dynamic tools/resources from Flutter apps
  void registerDynamicTool(Tool tool, String sourceApp, int dartVmPort, {Map<String, dynamic> metadata = const {}});
  void registerDynamicResource(Resource resource, String sourceApp, int dartVmPort, {Map<String, dynamic> metadata = const {}});

  // Cleanup when apps disconnect
  void unregisterDynamicApp(String sourceApp);
}
```

## Integration Pattern

### Wrapper-Based Integration

Unlike the TypeScript version which intercepts MCP protocol directly, the Dart version uses a cleaner wrapper pattern:

1. **Dynamic Registration**: Tools/resources are registered in the `DynamicRegistry`
2. **MCP Registration**: Same tools/resources are registered in standard MCP framework with forwarding wrappers
3. **Forwarding**: MCP calls are forwarded to the appropriate Flutter app via the registry
4. **Cleanup**: Both dynamic and MCP registrations are cleaned up together

This approach provides:

- ✅ Full MCP protocol compliance
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing tools
- ✅ Standard MCP client behavior
- ✅ Automatic notifications and lifecycle management

## Configuration and Usage

### 1. Server Integration

Add the mixin to your MCP server:

```dart
final class MCPToolkitServer extends BaseMCPToolkitServer
    with VMServiceSupport, DynamicRegistryIntegration {

  @override
  FutureOr<InitializeResult> initialize(InitializeRequest request) async {
    // Initialize dynamic registry (configurable)
    initializeDynamicRegistry(enabled: true);

    return super.initialize(request);
  }
}
```

### 2. Configuration Options

```dart
// Enable/disable dynamic registry
initializeDynamicRegistry(enabled: configuration.dynamicRegistryEnabled);

// Register tools from Flutter apps
registerDynamicTool(tool, 'MyFlutterApp', 12345, metadata: {'version': '1.0'});

// Register resources from Flutter apps
registerDynamicResource(resource, 'MyFlutterApp', 12345);

// Cleanup when app disconnects
unregisterDynamicApp('MyFlutterApp');
```

### 3. Management Tools Configuration

The management tools (`listClientToolsAndResources`, `runClientTool`, `runClientResource`) are automatically registered when dynamic registry is enabled. This provides:

- **Discoverability**: Clients can see what dynamic tools/resources are available
- **Execution**: Clients can run dynamic tools through standard MCP protocol
- **Monitoring**: Clients can get statistics and metadata about registrations

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅

- [x] `DynamicRegistry` - Core registry with MCP compliance
- [x] `DynamicRegistryTools` - Management tools
- [x] `DynamicRegistryIntegration` - Server integration mixin
- [x] Event streaming and monitoring

### Phase 2: Flutter Client Integration

- [ ] Flutter MCP client library for dynamic registration

- [ ] Connection management and auto-cleanup
- [ ] Example Flutter app with dynamic tools

### Phase 3: Communication Layer

- [ ] VM Service extension for tool/resource registration
- [ ] JSON-RPC communication between server and Flutter apps
- [ ] Error handling and connection resilience
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

- [ ] Tool/resource versioning and updates
- [ ] Permission system for dynamic registrations
- [ ] Tool dependency management
- [ ] Advanced monitoring and analytics

### 3. Communication Security

- Use secure channels for Flutter app communication
- Validate app identity and permissions
- Encrypt sensitive tool arguments/results
