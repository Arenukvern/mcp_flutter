The idea is to copy& paste the devtools_app_shared code here
because it doesn't work if it is imported as a package

There is two paths from now:

1. We can try to `do not change` anything in the folder underneath devtools_core.
2. We can `adapt` the codebase to mcp needs.

Current status - trying the first way.
